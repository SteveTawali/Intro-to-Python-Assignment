# Basic Calculator Program - Assignment
Power Learn Project  

## Assignment Description

This project implements a simple command-line calculator in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including user input, conditional statements, error handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement user input and output
- Use conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Handle basic error conditions (division by zero)
- Perform arithmetic operations
- Create a functional command-line application

## Features Implemented

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Division by zero error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the program:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Program Flow

1. Display welcome message
2. Prompt for first number
3. Prompt for second number
4. Display operation options
5. Get user's operation choice
6. Perform calculation and display result
7. Handle division by zero error if applicable

## Example Output

```
Welcome to Simple Calculator
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Choose an operation: 
1. +
2. -
3. *
4. /
Enter your choice (+, -, *, /): +
Result is: 15.0
```

## Code Structure

The program uses:
- `input()` function for user interaction
- `float()` conversion for numeric input
- `if/elif/else` statements for operation selection
- Conditional logic for error handling

## Assignment Reflection

This assignment helped me understand:
- Basic Python syntax and structure
- User input/output handling
- Conditional logic implementation
- Error handling concepts
- Program flow control

## Future Improvements

If I were to enhance this calculator, I would add:
- Input validation for non-numeric values
- Loop functionality for multiple calculations
- Additional mathematical operations
- More robust error handling
